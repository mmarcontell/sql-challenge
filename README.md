# SQL Challenge

Using 6 CSV files from an employee database, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered numerous questions about their contents. 

Separated into two .sql files, one for organizing the data and one for analysing it, I have documented each query and table creation. The results are specified as each query is run.

In addition, I have created an ERD to visualize the flow of information from table to table, which I used while making my queries. It is located in the EmployeeSQL folder as a .png.
